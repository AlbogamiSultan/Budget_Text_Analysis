# Introduction

Text analysis has been defined as the automated process that allows machines to extract and classify information from text. Businesses might use text analysis to extract specific information such as keywords, names, and organization information. Businesses may also categorize text with tags according to topic, point of view or classify them as positive or negative. In this project our goal is to preform textual analysis on seven budget documents from different counties and cities across the state of North Carolina. By applying advanced text analysis methods, such as Topic Modelling and Sentiment Analysis, our team is hoping to extract meaningful information from each budget document individually and collectively. The team is also aiming to build a recommendation engine that may assist with the typing process of these budget documents in the future. <br/>
