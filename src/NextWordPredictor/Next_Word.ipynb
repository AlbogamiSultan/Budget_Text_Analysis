This is 6.7% ($36.85 million) higher than the budget approved for FY 2007-08. \\n\\nProperty Tax revenues will account for 54% of the total revenue budget next fiscal year. The next largest \\n\\nsources of funds for general county operations are Federal and State Funds (17%) and Sales Tax \\n\\nrevenues (13%). The FY 2008-09 adopted budget includes a general county wide tax rate of $0.7374 for \\n\\neach $100 of assessed property valuation. This is an increase of 4.6 cents over the tax rate during FY \\n\\n2008-09. Property Tax revenues, including payments and penalties for taxes due in prior years, will \\n\\nincrease $29.2 million in FY 2008-09. In addition, the County expects an increase in Federal and State \\n\\nfunds (+$11.9 million) and revenues derived from User Charges/Fees (+$4.6 million). Recent state \\n\\nlegislation tied to Medicaid relief will result in the state retaining a portion of sales tax revenues \\n\\npreviously received by Guilford County. As a result, sales tax revenues are expected to fall by $7.7 \\n\\nmillion. Additional details regarding the county’s revenues are available on the following pages.

Property tax revenues are based on the assessed value of property \\n\\nin the county, the tax rate set by the Board of Commissioners, and a collection rate that represents the \\n\\nactual percentage of the total tax levy the county can reasonably expect to collect. For FY 2008-2009, \\n\\nthe ad valorem property tax is estimated to generate approximately 54% of total General Fund \\n\\nrevenues, or nearly $318.3 million. Current year taxes (i.e., taxes paid on time) will generate $316.3 \\n\\nmillion of the total revenues estimated for next year, while the remaining $2,000,000 will come from \\n\\npayments made for taxes originally due in prior years. Assessed Value of Taxable Property Like all North \\n\\nCarolina counties, Guilford County levies a property tax on four general types of property: Real Property \\n\\n(e.g., houses, land); Motor Vehicles/Automobiles; Personal Property (e.g., boats, business machinery); \\n\\nand property held by businesses that is routinely moved among various jurisdictions in the course of \\n\\nnormal business, such as property owned by utilities, railroads, and trucking companies (called Public \\n\\nService property). For FY 2008-2009, the total assessed valuation of all types of taxable property in \\n\\nGuilford County is estimated to be approximately $44,204,500,000. This reflects an increase of 2.4%, \\n\\nslightly less than the 3% experienced in FY 2007-2008. This growth rate is based on the Tax \\n\\nDepartment’s review of activity since FY 2007-2008 values were set and uncertainty regarding economic \\n\\nconditions over the next fiscal year. Assessed Property Values $21.1 $22.1 $23.1 $23.8 $24.5 $31.8 \\n\\n$32.7 $33.6 $34.7 $35.7 $3.1 $3.2 $3.4 $3.4 $3.4 $3.3 $3.5 $3.7 $3.8 $3.8 $3.5 $3.7 $3.8 $3.7 $3.4 $3.4 \\n\\n$3.4 $3.5 $3.6 $3.7 $1.05 $1.01 $1.09 $1.02 $0.92 $1.09 $1.10 $1.08 $1.04 $1.05 $- $5 $10 $15 $20 $25 \\n\\n$30 $35 $40 $45 $50 1999-00 2000-01 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 Reval 2005-06 2006-07 2007-\\n\\n08 2008-09 Budget Billions Real Motor Vehicle Personal Public Service 43 As the chart below indicates, \\n\\nReal and Personal property values are estimated to increase by 2.7% and 2.0%, respectively. Motor \\n\\nvehicle values showed no real growth from FY 2006-07 to FY 2007-08. No growth in vehicle values is \\n\\nprojected for FY 2008-2009, reflecting the concern that discretionary consumer spending for items such \\n\\nas new cars will show no significant increase over the next year. Finally, Public Service property values \\n\\n\\n\\nare established by the state at 100% of value. In the fourth year following a county wide property \\n\\nrevaluation, Public Service companies are eligible to request a reduction in property value to better \\n\\nreflect the current sales to assessed value ratio in the county. FY 2008-2009 is the first year Public \\n\\nService companies may apply for this adjustment. As a result, no increase in value is projected for this \\n\\nproperty class. Property Tax Rate The FY 2008-2009 budget includes a property tax rate of 73.74 cents \\n\\nfor every $100 of assessed property valuation. This represents an increase of 4.6 cents over the FY 2007-\\n\\n2008 rate of 69.14. In dollars, this means a property owner in Guilford County would pay $737.40 in \\n\\nproperty taxes in FY 2008-2009 for each $100,000 of taxable property owned. This would be an increase \\n\\nof $46 (for each $100,000 of property) over the amount paid in FY 2007-2008. Collection Rate When \\n\\nestimating property tax revenues, North Carolina counties must consider the fact that they will not \\n\\ncollect 100% of the total taxes billed in a given year. To comply with this requirement, all counties, \\n\\nincluding Guilford County, apply a collection rate percentage to the estimated total property tax levy. \\n\\nThe collection rate used cannot be more than the percentage of taxes actually collected during the prior \\n\\nfiscal year. In Guilford County, the overall collection rate was 98.65% in FY 2006-07. The FY 2008-09 \\n\\nbudget assumes a collection rate of 97.5%. This is about 1% below the maximum rate the county could \\n\\nuse and reflects the growing concern over the strength of our national and local economies. As the level \\n\\nof economic uncertainty increases, so does the need to conservatively budget the county’s largest \\n\\nsource of revenue. Not only does this approach guard against a decline in property tax collections, it also \\n\\nprovides a small margin of protection against declines in other revenues (such sales taxes) that are \\n\\nhighly sensitive to changing economic conditions. Federal and State Funds $102,498,015 Guilford County \\n\\nexpects to receive just under $102.5 million in revenues from the federal and state government, or \\n\\nabout 17.5% of total General Fund revenues. This represents an increase of nearly $11.9 million (13.1%) \\n\\nover the FY 2007-08 budget. Nearly all of the federal and state revenue expected to be received in FY \\n\\n2008-2009 will be used to offset the costs for the Public Health, Social Services, and Mental Health \\n\\ndepartments. These departments are responsible for administering a number of state and federal \\n\\nprograms (see descriptions of their services in the Percentage Change in Assessed Property Values Type \\n\\nof Property Motor Public Real Vehicles Personal Service Total FY 2006-07 2.8% 8.4% 2.7% 3.2% 3.3% FY \\n\\n2007-08 3.4% 0.0% 3.1% 1.4% 3.1% FY 2008-09 Estimated 2.7% 0.0% 2.0% 0.7% 2.4% 44 Human Services \\n\\nsection of this document) and receive outside funds for doing so. Some of the increase in this revenue \\n\\nsource is related to the addition of 16 new positions in Social Services and Public Health. These positions \\n\\nwill be funded 100% from additional federal and state revenues or client fees. FY 2007-08 was the first \\n\\nyear the County began using revenues from the state lottery to fund additional debt service for \\n\\nconstruction projects of the Guilford County Schools. Lottery funds can only be used for debt service on \\n\\nborrowing conducted after 2003 or for selected school capital needs. The budget includes a total of \\n\\n$12.5 million of lottery funds -- $8 million from estimated current year collections and $4.5 million from \\n\\nprior year collections being held in the county’s name by the state. Sales Tax $77,600,000 Sales Tax \\n\\nrevenues are expected to generate $77,600,000 next fiscal year, or about 13.2% of total county \\n\\nrevenues. As a result of recently enacted Medicaid relief legislation (discussed below), this amount is 9% \\n\\nlower than the $82,500,000 in revenues included in the FY 2007-08 budget. The North Carolina General \\n\\nAssembly allows counties to levy up to four individual local option sales taxes that total 2.5% (one 1.0% \\n\\ntax and three 0.50% taxes). These local taxes are in addition to the state’s sales tax of up to 4.25%, \\n\\ndepending on the product purchased. As a result, consumers pay between 2.0% and 6.75% sales tax on \\n\\ntheir purchases in Guilford County. (This allocation of sales tax will change during FY 2008-09 as \\n\\ndiscussed below.) Although consumers pay these taxes in Guilford County, the actual amount of sales \\n\\n\\n\\ntax revenues returned to the local governments in the county depends on a number of factors, including \\n\\nGuilford County’s share of the total state population, the strength of local collections, and sales tax \\n\\nperformance statewide. Once the total amount of sales tax returned to the county as a whole is \\n\\ndetermined, the amount of revenue a particular local government receives is based on the unit’s \\n\\nproperty tax levy compared to the levies for all local units of government during the prior fiscal year. For \\n\\ninstance, in FY 2007-08 the property taxes levied by Guilford County Government represented 58.6% of \\n\\nall of the property taxes levied in the county. As a result, Guilford County can expect to receive 58.6% of \\n\\nthe total sales tax revenues returned to county as a whole in FY 2008- 09. This amount varies from year \\n\\nto year as both the assessed values and property tax rates change in various jurisdictions. The state’s \\n\\nslowing economy continues to impact sales tax revenues. At the time this budget was prepared, total \\n\\nyear-to-date sales tax revenues distributed to all local governments in Guilford County were about 1% \\n\\nhigher than last year, with some components showing no growth, particularly in recent months. Given \\n\\nthe current year’s weak performance and the effect rising fuel and food prices could have on \\n\\ndiscretionary Federal and State Revenues $85.8 $84.6 $84.6 $88.9 $90.0 $6.0 $12.5 $- $20 $40 $60 $80 \\n\\n$100 $120 FY 2004-05 FY 2005-06 FY 2006-07 FY 2007-08 Adopted FY 2008-09 Adopted Millions Other \\n\\nLottery Funds 45 spending, this budget assumes no growth in the total amount of overall sales tax \\n\\nrevenues returned to the county as a whole over the next fiscal year. Beginning in October 2008, the \\n\\nstate of North Carolina will retain the revenues generated by half of one of the 0.5% local option taxes \\n\\nas part of the Medicaid relief legislation approved last year by the General Assembly. In exchange for \\n\\ntaking this revenue stream from counties, the state will pay 50% of the counties’ Medicaid costs after \\n\\nOctober 2008. Because municipalities receive a portion of the sales taxes generated in their counties, \\n\\nthe legislation also includes a provision that counties hold municipalities harmless from any sales tax \\n\\nlosses. This hold harmless amount is projected to be nearly $3.6 million next fiscal year. Although the \\n\\nrelief legislation does not require the county to protect fire districts or other tax districts against any \\n\\nsales tax losses, the adopted budget assumes $175,000 in hold harmless funds for these districts. The \\n\\nnet effect of all of the items discussed above is that Guilford County Government’s sales tax revenues \\n\\nwill decline approximately 10% from the amount expected in FY 2008-09. User Fees and Charges \\n\\n$38,125,841 Guilford County departments expect to generate over $38.1 million from fees and other \\n\\ncharges for services (6.5% of total), such as fees for ambulance transportation, marriage licenses, and \\n\\nmedical visits to the Health Department and Mental Health. Most user fees and charges are collected by \\n\\nPublic Safety and Human Services departments. The FY 2008-09 budget projects an increase of $4.55 \\n\\nmillion, or 13.6%, over the current year’s budget. The adopted budget includes fee increases for \\n\\nselected Health Sales Tax Revenues $70.0 $77.4 $80.6 $86.1 $86.2 $77.6 $0 $10 $20 $30 $40 $50 $60 \\n\\n$70 $80 $90 $100 FY 2003-04 FY 2004-05 FY 2005-06 FY 2006-07 FY 2007-08 Estimated FY 2008-09 \\n\\nAdopted Millions User Fees and Charges $15.5 $17.0 $16.1 $15.1 $17.0 $19.6 $19.6 $14.7 $12.5 $15.8 \\n\\n$6.2 $6.8 $5.9 $6.0 $5.3 $0 $5 $10 $15 $20 $25 $30 $35 $40 $45 $50 FY 2004-05 FY 2005-06 FY 2006-07 \\n\\nFY 2007-08 Adopted FY 2008-09 Adopted Millions Public Safety Human Services Other 46 Department \\n\\nand medical transport services. Please see the detail pages for the Health Department (in the Human \\n\\nServices section) and Emergency Services (in the Public Safety section) for more detail. The expected \\n\\nreceipt of additional Medicaid fees for contracted community mental health services is the primary \\n\\nreason for the increase in fees for FY 2008-09. Additional fees are projected for Emergency Services as \\n\\nbudgeted revenue is projected to more accurately reflect actual revenue performance in prior years. \\n\\nThis category also includes fees collected for planning and inspection services, court facility fees, and \\n\\nfees received from area municipalities for animal control and animal shelter services. Fund Balance (all \\n\\n\\n\\nsources) $27,094,564 Fund Balance is the money that remains unspent after all budgeted expenditures \\n\\nhave been made. It is generated when collected revenues exceed actual expenditures, and is important \\n\\nfor several reasons. First, it provides cash to pay expenditures in the early part of the fiscal year before \\n\\ntaxes are collected. In addition, it provides a source of funds during the year that can be tapped if \\n\\nsignificant unplanned expenditures occur. Finally, it may be used by the Board during the budget \\n\\ndevelopment process to help fund county operations. The North Carolina Local Government \\n\\nCommission (LGC) recommends that counties maintain a minimum Fund Balance of 8% of General Fund \\n\\nexpenditures to ensure sufficient funds are available to support operations and address unexpected \\n\\nissues. A Fund Balance of higher than 8% strengthens a local government’s financial position as it \\n\\nprovides a greater margin of protection for operations. The FY 2008-09 approved General Fund budget \\n\\nincludes just over $26.4 million of unearmarked fund balance (i.e., money that may be used for all \\n\\noperations). The budget also includes approximately $683,000 in fund balance generated by, and \\n\\nearmarked for, certain Health Department, Law Enforcement, and Register of Deeds programs. The \\n\\nchart below outlines the calculation of the Local Government Commission’s recommended reserves, as \\n\\nwell as the total reserves associated with the FY 2008-09 budget. Due to uncertainty regarding future \\n\\nUnearmarked General Fund Balance in Adopted Budgets $14.4 $17.6 $23.5 $24.5 $24.7 $23.7 $26.4 $0 \\n\\n$5 $10 $15 $20 $25 $30 FY 2002-03 FY 2003-04 FY 2004-05 FY 2005-06 FY 2006-07 FY 2007-08 FY 2008-\\n\\n09 Millions 47 economic conditions and their impact on certain revenues, such as sales tax revenues, the \\n\\nadopted budget assumes a fund balance reserve of 8.1%, slightly higher than the LGC’s 8% \\n\\nrecommendation. Other Revenues $22,509,023 In FY 2008-09, Guilford County expects to receive $22.5 \\n\\nmillion in Other Revenues for the General Fund outside the categories listed above. These revenues are \\n\\nfrom a number of sources, including penalties for late payment of property taxes, cable television \\n\\nfranchise revenues, and grants or donations from various organizations. This total includes $500,000 \\n\\ntransferred from the County Building Construction Fund to offset the additional $500,000 allocated to \\n\\nGuilford Technical Community College for one-time capital needs associated with the new northwest \\n\\ncampus and improvements in the aviation program. These funds will come from funds set aside by the \\n\\nBoard of Commissioners in previous years for large capital expenditures. Also included in this category is \\n\\n$9,845,000 of expected investment earnings.

Although public \\n\\neducation is primarily a responsibility of the state, all counties are required to fund a portion of the \\n\\noperating and capital expenses for local public schools and community college systems. Most counties \\n\\nappropriate a substantial portion of their budget to support Education programs. For public school \\n\\nsystems, the General Statutes require that the following categories be provided for mainly from local \\n\\nfunds: • Buildings, furniture, and apparatus • Garage and maintenance equipment for school buses • \\n\\nLiability insurance • Maintenance of plant • Site acquisition • Furnishing of superintendent’s office • \\n\\nSchool building supplies • Water supply and sewerage facilities For community college systems, counties \\n\\nare required to fund maintenance and repairs to buildings and equipment, rent, utilities, costs of \\n\\ncustodians, insurance, legal fees, vehicles and vehicle maintenance, grounds maintenance, land \\n\\nacquisition, and facility construction. Guilford County appropriates funds for other items beyond the \\n\\nlegal mandates. For instance, the County provides funds for educator salary supplements to encourage \\n\\nteachers to work in Guilford County and pays for locally-paid positions and programs to respond to local \\n\\nneeds.

The additional \\n\\noperating funds will be used to pay the operating costs associated with new facilities (e.g., utilities, \\n\\ncustodial staff, insurance, maintenance staff, etc.), personnel costs of locally-paid positions, and various \\n\\nnon-salary increases (e.g., repairs to existing facilities, utilities, student financial aid, vehicle supplies and \\n\\nrepairs, etc.) The College’s capital appropriation will be used for infrastructure needs for the proposed \\n\\nnorthwest campus and aviation facility renovations to support growth in that program’s enrollment. The \\n\\nbudget also includes debt service for college facilities, including $79.5 million in additional bonds \\n\\napproved by voters on May 6, 2008. These debt service amounts are included in the Non-Schools Debt \\n\\nsection of this summary. Human Services $181,909,959 Guilford County’s Human Services programs are \\n\\ndesigned to promote health lifestyles, prevent and control disease, protect the welfare of children, and \\n\\nensure that residents who are unable to provide for themselves and their families have access to health \\n\\ncare, employment training, and other social services activities. Guilford County is mandated by various \\n\\nstate and federal laws to provide and fund many of these activities. Guilford County will spend $181.9 \\n\\nmillion on Human Services expenditures next fiscal year, an increase of $2.36 million, or 1.3%. Human \\n\\nServices is the second largest expenditure category and accounts for 31% of proposed General Fund \\n\\nexpenditures for FY 2008-09. Departments in this category include Public Health, the Guilford Center \\n\\n(Mental Health), the Department of Social Services, Human Services Transportation, and the county’s \\n\\nshare of expenses for the mandated Medicaid and Special Assistance to Adults public assistance \\n\\nprograms.

The FY 2008- 09 budget for Mental Health includes a full year of operating expenses for the \\n\\ncounty’s recently opened Substance Abuse facility on Wendover Avenue. The Board of Commissioners \\n\\napproved this facility in the FY 2007-08 budget in an attempt to reduce the rise in the jail population by \\n\\nincreasing the availability of treatment services to people that have substance abuse issues. Almost all of \\n\\nthe increase in Social Services is related to the appropriation of additional funds for child day care \\n\\nservices (100% non-county funded) and for the county’s share of increased expenses related to children \\n\\nin foster care. In addition, $274,500 of increased funding is included in the Transportation budget for the \\n\\n55 initial purchase of fleet vehicles. These funds will pay for five vehicles as the County begins to phase \\n\\nin full ownership of 48 transportation vehicles over the next several years. State grant funds are \\n\\navailable to pay 90% of the cost of the vehicles. The budget includes approximately $700,000 for 16 new \\n\\npositions for Human Services programs, all of which will be paid for with non-county funds. Eleven new \\n\\npositions have been approved for Social Services and will enhance services in the Child Day Care, Foster \\n\\nCare, and Family & Children Services program areas. The Public Health budget includes funds for five \\n\\nnew positions for the Women, Infants, and Children and Public Health Preparedness and Response \\n\\nprogram areas. In addition, the adopted budget includes $250,000 to support the establishment of a \\n\\n\\n\\nnew satellite health clinic to enhance access to medical care in the southeast portion of the county. \\n\\nMedicaid Medicaid expenditures are projected to decrease by $9.2 million next year as a result of the \\n\\nMedicaid Relief legislation recently passed by the General Assembly which included a provision for the \\n\\nstate to begin full assumption of the local share of Medicaid expenditures. The phase out of county \\n\\ncontribution began in FY 2007-08 with the state paying 25% of the county share beginning in October \\n\\n2007. The state will begin paying 50% of county Medicaid costs beginning July 1, 2008 (FY 2008-09) and \\n\\n100% of county costs beginning July 1, 2009 (FY 2009-10). In return for assuming these costs, the state \\n\\nwill begin retaining a percentage of the county’s sales tax revenues. Historically, Medicaid expenditures \\n\\nhave grown much faster than sales tax revenues. As a result, the county should enjoy long-term benefits \\n\\nfrom the new legislation Public Safety $88,658,445 At 15% of total proposed expenditures, Public Safety \\n\\nis the third largest service category in the General Fund. Guilford County’s Public Safety departments are \\n\\norganized to protect the safety of residents and visitors and include the Sheriff’s Department, \\n\\nEmergency Services, Building Inspections, and Animal Control Services. The FY 2008-09 budget includes \\n\\n$88.7 million for Public Safety services next fiscal year, an increase of $6.05 million, or 7.3%, over the \\n\\namount adopted for FY 2007-08. The largest increase in Public Safety expenditures is for Law \\n\\nEnforcement (Sheriff’s Department). Approximately $1.85 million of the increase will be used to fully \\n\\nfund 28 Detention Officers added by the Board of Commissioners early in calendar year 2008 and to add \\n\\neight new positions in FY 2008-09. These new positions include four Road Deputies to enhance patrol \\n\\nservices and four Bailiffs to provide additional Human Services Expenditures $7.4 $7.7 $8.8 $8.8 $10.1 \\n\\n$65.0 $64.0 $64.3 $68.7 $72.3 $22.2 $23.4 $23.6 $27.0 $17.9 $32.7 $34.1 $34.6 $37.3 $39.5 $41.9 $41.5 \\n\\n$35.7 $37.8 $42.1 $0 $20 $40 $60 $80 $100 $120 $140 $160 $180 $200 FY 2004-05 FY 2005-06 FY 2006-\\n\\n07 FY 2007-08 Adopted FY 2008-09 Adopted Millions Other Social Services Public Assistance Mandates \\n\\nPublic Health Mental Health 56 court security. Additional funds are also included for increased food \\n\\ncosts for inmates, elevator improvements at the High Point Detention Facility, and additional vehicle \\n\\nfuel costs. In addition to adding eight new Law Enforcement positions, the budget includes four new \\n\\npositions for Emergency Services. These Emergency Medical/Logistic Technicians will improve \\n\\noperational efficiency by preparing pre-stocked supply kits of medical supplies and equipment for \\n\\nambulances. These pre-stocked kits will reduce the time it takes to prep ambulances in between calls, \\n\\nthereby increasing the daily utilization of these expensive assets and their crews. Other Public Safety \\n\\nexpenditure highlights include additional funds for rabies specimen testing and building maintenance for \\n\\nAnimal Services/Shelter; full year funding for the Drug Court in High Point (established this fiscal year); \\n\\nand replacement vehicles for Law Enforcement, Animal Control, and Emergency Services. The FY 2008-\\n\\n09 budget includes special fire district rate increases for the following fire departments: Alamance \\n\\nCommunity Fire Department (from $0.819 to $0.1000 per $100 valuation), Climax Fire Department \\n\\n(from $0.0930 to $0.1000 per $100 valuation), and Northeast Guilford Fire Department (from $0.0800 to \\n\\n$0.0900 per $100 valuation).

Just over $48.1 million of this total is for School Debt and is discussed in the Education \\n\\nsection above. The remaining $21.6 million will pay debt service for all other debtfinanced projects. This \\n\\nNonSchool debt service includes payments for a new Emergency Services base, a proposed new facility \\n\\nfor Social Services in High Point, community college facilities, and water and sewer networks. It also \\n\\nincludes anticipated funding the voter-approved bonds passed on May 6, 2008 for a new jail facility in \\n\\nGreensboro and various community college projects, as well as the purchase of the BB&T building at the \\n\\ncorner of South Greene and West Market Streets.

The county is required under the North Carolina \\n\\nGeneral Statutes to conduct a general reappraisal of all real property within its borders every eight \\n\\nyears. The next reappraisal must be completed by January 1, 2012. The revaluation of over 200,000 \\n\\nparcels of real property by 2012 will require the addition of appraisers to the department’s staff.

All of \\n\\nthese positions will not be filled all of the time in FY 2008-09, so it is not necessary to budget 100% of \\n\\nthe calculated Personnel Services budgets for all departments. As a result, the budgets for Public Health, \\n\\nLaw Enforcement, Social Services, Emergency Services, and Court Alternatives have been reduced by a \\n\\ntotal of $1.34 million to account for anticipated vacancy savings typically experienced in these large \\n\\ndepartments. Accounting for vacancies when the budget is developed reduces the amount of funds that \\n\\nis needed to balance the budget. Apart from $1.34 million already excluded from department budgets, \\n\\nthe Board of Commissioners directed, through the adoption of the budget, that an additional $1,000,000 \\n\\nin vacancy savings be generated during the fiscal year. These savings are not assigned to specific \\n\\ndepartments at the beginning of the year, but will be generated as vacancies occur beyond those \\n\\nalready anticipated in the $1.34 million. In addition, the adopted budget requires the elimination of \\n\\napproximately 20 positions by the end of the fiscal year. The elimination of these positions is expected \\n\\nto generate an additional $900,000 in savings. 62 General Fund Expenditures Actual Adopted Amended \\n\\nAdopted Change vs. Adopted FY 2006-07 FY2007-08 FY 2007-08 FY 2008-09 $ % Expenditure Category \\n\\nPersonnel Services $ 164,738,596 $ 172,729,510 $ 173,439,280 $ 178,396,329 $ 5,666,819 3.3% \\n\\nOperating Expenses $ 251,579,080 $ 267,560,014 $ 276,012,062 $ 289,307,234 $ 21,747,220 8.1% \\n\\nHuman Services Assistance $ 48,833,480 $ 54,697,047 $ 55,502,799 $ 47,601,916 $ (7,095,131) -13.0% \\n\\nDebt - Bonds & BB&T* $ 41,290,560 $ 52,304,850 $ 52,304,952 $ 69,706,993 $ 17,402,143 33.3% Other \\n\\n$ (1,154,517) $ (3,084,726) $ (1,624,961) $ (3,245,350) $ (160,624) 5.2% Capital Outlay* $ 3,224,137 $ \\n\\n5,055,129 $ 5,214,395 $ 4,348,020 $ (707,109) -14.0% * Adopted amounts used for debt and Education \\n\\ncapital.
